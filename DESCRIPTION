Description: To produce the figures and the simulations results, an extensive simulations
            has been conducted in the paper Hasan and Schliekelman (2017). In this
            package, we wraps the functions needed to reproduce the figures 
             and the simulations results described in the paper. We also showed 
             real life examples.
